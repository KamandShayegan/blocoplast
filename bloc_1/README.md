This mini app is called *The Observer*. \
The Observer is given this app and it's responsibility is to hand out the name of all the bad students to the manager. \
The observer writes each students name and adds it to the list and removes students if they become better students over time. \
p.s. The functionality is implemented using bloc (cubit to be exact - due to non-reactive events).
